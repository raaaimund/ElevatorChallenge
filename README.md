# ElevatorChallenge

![build and test project](https://github.com/raaaimund/ElevatorChallenge/workflows/build%20and%20test%20project/badge.svg?branch=master)

Hi, sadly I had some work to finish last week and was also a little bit ill since the week before, therefore you have to deal with 2 am code ^^

## Docker

I dockerized it for you because I used C# instead of Java.

```
docker-compose up
```

Have a nice week :)

## Elevators & Requests

You can add elevators and requests in [ElevatorSystemWithTestData.cs](/ElevatorChallenge.Commandline/ElevatorSystemWithTestData.cs).
